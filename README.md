## Architecture
The application embodies a three-layered architecture:

- **Presentation Layer**: The user interface, thoughtfully designed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5.3, and Blazor WebAssembly, facilitates seamless interactions for adding vehicles and customers, viewing current bookings, and managing vehicle rentals.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Addresses tasks such as adding a new vehicle, validating customer data, and overseeing the processes of vehicle rentals and returns.
- **Data Access Layer**: Currently, the application employs SeedData as a placeholder, anticipating future integration with a more comprehensive storage solution.

## Features
- **List Management**: Enables users to view current bookings, available vehicles, and registered customers.
- **Add Vehicles and Customers**: Intuitive forms support users in adding cars, motorcycles, and customers.
- **Rent & Return**: Streamlines the process for renting and returning vehicles.
- **Simple Validation**: Implements checks on customer details to ensure alignment with expected formats.
- **Toggle Instructions**: An inclusive guide caters to users who may be new to the system.

## How to Use
1. **Start the App**: The initial view displays available vehicles, current bookings, and registered customers.
2. **Adding**: Users can populate the provided forms with details of a new car, motorcycle, or customer.
3. **Renting**: The application allows users to select a vehicle and a customer to initiate a rental transaction.
4. **Returning**: Post rental, the system offers an option to register the vehicle as returned.

### Note:
The application presently utilizes SeedData as a data placeholder, with plans for future enhancement to encompass a broader data storage solution.
